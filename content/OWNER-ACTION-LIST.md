Find a comfortable position, close your eyes,
and take three deep breaths with me...

[BREATHING SECTION - 1 minute]

Now, bring to mind three things you're grateful for today.
Not big things necessarily - small moments count.
A warm cup of coffee. A message from a friend.
The fact that you woke up with another chance.

[PAUSE - 30 seconds]

As you hold gratitude in your heart, set your intention.
What is the ONE thing that, if you accomplished it today,
would make everything else easier or unnecessary?

[PAUSE - 30 seconds]

Visualize yourself completing that one thing.
See it done. Feel the satisfaction.
That version of you already exists.
You're just walking toward them.

[PAUSE - 1 minute]

Now, take one more deep breath.
On your exhale, open your eyes.
You're ready.
Today, you become who you were meant to be.

Go create ripples."
